I like to do research in the fields of 3D geometry processing, 3D vision and human-computer interaction. I like to investigate how new tools -especially 3d vision tools- can help more people design and fabricate their own things.

During my Ph.D., I have published four conference papers and one paper at the IEEE computer graphics and applications journal.  My Ph.D. dissertation was focused on developing tools to help novices in carving 3D models using a projector-camera system. Using the system novices could carve fine model details at sub-millimeter accuracy. The other part of my dissertation was focused on developing new 3D scanning technologies to be used in personal design and fabrication.
