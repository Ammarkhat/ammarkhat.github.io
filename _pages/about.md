I am a researcher and a software engineer working in the fields of 3D geometry processing, 3D vision, and human-computer interaction. I like to investigate how new tools -especially 3D vision tools- can help more people design and fabricate their own things.

I did my Ph.D at Brown University under the supervision of [Prof. Gabriel Taubin](http://mesh.brown.edu/taubin/index.html) from the school of Engineering.

Currently, I am working as a senior software engineer at [Desktop Metal](https://www.desktopmetal.com/). My work involves designing and optimizing new 3D geometry processing algorithms in the 3D printing pipeline.
