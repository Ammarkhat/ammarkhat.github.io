3D scanning is an important component in the field of personal fabrication. Most often, users want to design around existing physical parts while they don’t have the source 3d models for these parts. In these cases, the user can 3d scan the existing parts, and use the scanned models as inputs to the SmartCAD tools to generate parts that connect, hold, or cover them. However, the result of 3D scanning is usually a point cloud. Converting this point cloud to a CAD model useful for design is called reverse engineering, which’s a tedious process that requires a lot of manual editing. I propose developing new 3D scanning methods with the goal of outputting a CAD model ready to be used for design.
