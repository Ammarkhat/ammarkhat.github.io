title: "Hellium Balloons Vehicle"
excerpt: "Yarmouk University, BA project 2008
<br/>  I built a Computer-Controlled Helium Balloons system, where the
    user could control the movement of the Flying balloons wirelessly from
    the computer, the supporting software allows the user to draw a 3D map
    of the area where Helium balloons fly. It also allows the user to select
    a target point, and the system will autonomously move Helium balloons to
    that point, (My Project in its current state accepts only simple paths).
    A wireless camera was attached to Helium Balloons, and a live view of the
    camera is seen in the supporting software, The supporting software apply
    some Image Processing Techniques on this live video and it identifies any
    white line path on the ground.
