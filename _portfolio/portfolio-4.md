  I studied different algorithms of drawing Bezier curves, and
            I proposed a new algorithm for enhancing the rendering
            of Bezier curves by cashing the intermediate lines segments that approximate
            the curve; by cashing them between subsequent animation steps and measured
            the enhanced performance, and evaluated the result.
