title: "3D Carving machine from scratch!"
excerpt: "Yarmouk University, BA graduation project 2008 
<br/> I developed a 3-Axis 3D CNC carving machine, which can carve in flower
    foam (or other Materials like wood) some 3D Model Drawn by the user (with
    some limitations). I wrote software that will drive the machine.
    the software allows the user to load standard 3D Model File (.X Format)
    which contains the 3D Model; the software will then apply some algorithms
    (Computer Aided Manufacturing Algorithms CAM) to the 3D Model to find a
    complete 3D path for the carving head (called Toolpath), I implemented
    contour parallel and direction parallel CAM algorithms , the computer will
    send this complete path in a standard form (like GCode) to a Microcontroller
    connected to it (rabbit 3000), the microcontroller will send commands to
    3 stepper motors (one for each axis) and to the head to follow the path
    and carve the wanted model.
    
    * I developed the machine from scratch (by combining old
    printers to form the structure, connecting the driving circuits on bread
    board (and trying different circuits), programming the microcontroller
    to drive the circuit and connect to computer, and writing the software
    on Visual C#.
