 In this project which lasted for two semesters I was part of a team of
            students, we tried to build a cylindrical display using a rotating arm of LEDs
            and persistence of vision phenomenon to produce the display, and I was
            responsible for software part in this project team, (verilog-FPGA, C on
            the microprocessor, and C# on the PC).
