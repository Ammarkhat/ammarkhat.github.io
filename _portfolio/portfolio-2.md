title: "Using Local Moment Invariants for Partial 3D Shape Matching and Retrieval"
excerpt: "Course project with with Prof. Gabriel Taubin, Brown University. (2013)
<br/>Moment Invariants are normally used as Global shape descriptors, the goal of this project is to use them as a Local shape descriptor, and to build a 3D shape retrieval and matching system based on moment invariants.
