excerpt: "Patent Pending: <a href='https://patents.google.com/patent/US20130307919A1/en'>US20130307919A1</a> with Prof. Gabriel Taubin, Brown University (2013)
<br/> In this independent research project that lasted for two semesters I have built a low cost USB video switch device, which can combine the video from multiple UVC compliant USB cameras to emulate a real UVC webcam gadget (capturing live video from different video capture source), I have used BeagleBoard Xm and 4 Microsoft LifeCam 5000 USB cameras
