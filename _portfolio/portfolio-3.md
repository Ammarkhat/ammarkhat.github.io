 In this independent research project that lasted for two semesters I have built a low cost USB video switch device, which can combine the video from multiple UVC compliant USB cameras to emulate a real UVC webcam gadget (capturing live video from different video capture source), I have used BeagleBoard Xm and 4 Microsoft LifeCam 5000 USB cameras
