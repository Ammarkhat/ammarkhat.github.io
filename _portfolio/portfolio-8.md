title: "Accelerated Voice Calculator"
excerpt: "Course project. (Brown University, 2012)
<br/>I have accelerated a Command Recognition system using FPGA (Altera DE2
            board), we have started with an open source C code
            for voice recognition (that recognizes isolated words) then we ran that
            code on NIOS II soft processor, then we accelerated that code by converting
            parts of it to hardware. In the final demo we presented a Voice Controlled
            Calculator that performs addition, subtraction, and multiplication on two
            numbers, all controlled by voice.
